# VRDP Student Guide

This portion of the guide really only exists because Sphinx has a hard
time with conditional building.  The student guide for the most part is
a subset of the instructor guide but it is difficult to do that with
Sphinx alone.  So most of the files in here really just include the
exact same content from the instructor guide.  Therefore this guide
does not stand alone.

Some build warning will occur as the student guide reuses some
code from the instructor guide with broken links.  Those links are
however not relevant for the student guide.
