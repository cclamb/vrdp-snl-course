**Context**

 * Did the developers of the FLIC decoder properly fix their problems?

**Solution**

.. container:: toggle

 .. container:: toggle-header

    Show/Hide

 .. container:: toggle-body

    .. code-block:: c
       :linenos:
       :emphasize-lines: 17,20,23,29

	   start_line = (data[0] + (data[1] << 8));
	   lines = (data[2] + (data[3] << 8));
	   if (start_line + lines > flxdec->hdr.height) {
		 GST_ERROR_OBJECT (flxdec, "Invalid FLI packet detected. too many lines.");
		 return FALSE;
	   }
	   data += 4;
	 
	   /* start position of delta */
	   dest += (flxdec->hdr.width * start_line);
	   start_p = dest;
	 
	   while (lines--) {
		 /* packet count */
		 packets = *data++;
	 
		 while (packets--) {
		   /* skip count */
		   guchar skip = *data++;
		   dest += skip;
	 
		   /* RLE count */
		   count = *data++;
	 
		   if (count > 0x7f) {
			 /* literal run */
			 count = 0x100 - count;
	 
			 if (skip + count > flxdec->hdr.width) {
			   GST_ERROR_OBJECT (flxdec, "Invalid FLI packet detected. "
				   "line too long.");
			   return FALSE;
			 }
	 
			 x = *data++;
			 while (count--)
			   *dest++ = x;

    Let's use desk checking (assume remaining ``dest`` and ``width`` is 100 bytes):

    ======== =========== ======== ========= ==================== ==========
    Loop\@17 ``packets`` ``skip`` ``count`` ``skip+count>width`` Î” ``dest``
    ======== =========== ======== ========= ==================== ==========
        1         2        99        1            false             100 
        2         1        99        1            false           **200**
    ======== =========== ======== ========= ==================== ==========


    Multiple packets can each indicate a skip and as long as no individual skip
    plus count is larger than the width, there is still the ability to write past
    the end of the ``dest`` buffer.
