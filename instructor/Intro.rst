VRDP Defined
------------

Over the years of doing vulnerability research at SNL it seemed to
many around that it takes about two years of doing standard project work before
a new person becomes an *independently effective* vulnerability researcher.
This tended to involve a lot of frustration for those wanting to get into VR
because there really isn't a recipe for getting good at it.  Trainings at
conferences tend to be brief, project work was sometimes not representative of
basic skills needed, and it is difficult to know if one is on the right track.
The idea behind this course is to compress the time frame by which one can turn
a generally educated computer scientist into a vulnerability researcher by
curating the kinds of experiences they receive over a shorter amount of time.

The VRDP course aims to provide learning in as many real life sitations as
possible.  The vast majority of code used for practice is real world code with
real bugs or with no known bugs.  It is a firm belief that it is of no use to
train someone to spot bugs in toy code, only to then expect them to do a
good job against real and difficult code bases later.

VRDP is a mixture of teaching and practice.  Our model aims to have students
leave the course with the skills they need deeply ingrained so that they
can start solving the hard problems we often face at a National Laboratory.

History
-------

First offered at SNL in 2017, the VRDP course was a year-long experiment
with 4 students.  The results of the first year were considered highly
successful as students also contributed impactful VR outcomes while being
trained during the course of the year.  In 2018 the class size was doubled and
once again the students had success not only learning but delivering on
multiple real life concerns.

Starting in 2019, the course was reduced to 6 months in length for practical
reasons.  Having a cadre of people who were already trained provided an
opportunity for the graduates of the 6 month version to work on real problems
alongside those peers.  This seemed to be an adequate replacement for the
second 6 months of the course which had previously been weighted more toward
practice than instruction.  Graduates of the first 6 month version of the
course had success on their first project after exiting the course.

Starting in 2021, the course was modularized into sessions and delivered via
distance learning for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  A beginner
session consisting of modules 1-4, an intermediate session consisting of module
5-6, and an advanced session consisting of a selection of later modules were
spaced out months apart over the course of a year.  The challenge imposed by
COVID-19 restrictions showed that the content could be flexibly delivered.
This modular approach will likely remain the way SNL runs the course even if the
sessions return to an in-person model.

The original VRDP course was inspired, designed, and created by Ben
McBride.  Much of the concepts, course module design, and core content come
directly from his original contribution.

The VRDP Instructor and Student Guides were written by Nasser Salim.
Course content has changed greatly over the years especially with respect
to the module exercises.
